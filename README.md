# MongoDB $inc operator error: Incrementing a string field

This example demonstrates an incorrect usage of the MongoDB `$inc` operator, specifically trying to increment a string field.  The `$inc` operator is designed to increment numeric fields. Attempting to use it with a string results in an error or unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

The provided code snippet demonstrates an attempt to increment a string field using the `$inc` operator. This operation should result in an error because the `$inc` operator expects a numeric value.

## Solution

The correct approach is to ensure the field being incremented is of numeric type (int, long, double).  If the field is initially a string, it needs to be converted to a number before the increment operation or initialized as a number.
